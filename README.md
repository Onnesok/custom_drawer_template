This repo contains my custom app drawer template code... What is app drawer ?

An app drawer in Flutter is a side panel that slides in from the left or right edge of the screen, typically used for navigation within an app. It contains a list of menu items or links that users can tap on to navigate to different sections or screens of the app. The app drawer is often represented by a hamburger icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner of the app's interface, which, when tapped, reveals the drawer.

This app drawer provides a clean and modern UI, enhancing user navigation and overall app experience...... Feel free to test it for personal use....
